# Portfolio Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Enhance the project section (Resume section) in index.html by adding GitHub links to project titles and "View Details" buttons that open popups displaying screenshots and descriptions for each project (Notera and Ishara Setu).

## Steps
- [ ] Add GitHub links to project titles in the Resume section.
- [ ] Add "View Details" buttons for each project in the Resume section.
- [ ] Create Bootstrap modals for each project with image carousels and descriptions.
- [ ] Style modals to blend with portfolio design (use existing fonts, colors, and responsive layout).
- [ ] Test the popups and links to ensure they work correctly.
